- Bugfix: BelongsTo filter no longer does a LIKE search (since it's an explicit key)

### 2.3.0
- Relationship constraints are now possible if you want to limit one relationship field's options by its relation to another relationship field (only applies when those two fields themselves have a pivot table)
- You can now hit the enter key on text/textarea fields to submit the create/edit form
- Self-relationships are now possible
- Bugfix: Bool field now works properly with SQLite (or any database that returns ints as strings)
- Bugfix: History.js now recognizes base URIs other than '/'
- Bugfix: In PostgreSQL there was an issue with using boolean false to pull back no results on an integer column
- Bugfix: If you are on some high page number and you filter the set such that that page number is now outside the range of the filtered set, you will be brought back to the last page of the set instead of staying on that page
- Bugfix: Adding real-time viewModel updates to the wysiwyg field. Sometimes if you hit "save" fast enough it wouldn't write the changes back to the viewModel from the CKEditor
- Bugfix: There was an array index error when not providing a name_field or when only providing one of the sort options

### 2.2.0
- There is now an autocomplete option for relationships that could have a lot of potential values
- You can now set the $expand property for a model to boolean true or any integer above 285 (i.e. pixels) to get more room for the edit form
- Model config now allows for a 'single' name. Example: Film model would be 'film'. BoxOffice model would be 'take'. i.e. New film, New take
- New 'bool' field type
- New 'enum' field type
- New 'wysiwyg' field type
- New 'textarea' field type
- New 'markdown' field type
- Added 'limit' option for text/textarea/markdown field types

- You can now provide a create_link method in your model that should return the URL of the string of the item's front-end page
- You can now optionally provide a 'permission_check' closure for each model in the config. This works just like auth_check but on a per-model basis. If provided, and if it evaluates to false, the user will be redirected back to the admin dashboard.
- Bugfix: Multiple commas in number fields were messing up the values
- Bugfix: The custom binding for the number field now uses the user-supplied fields like decimals, thousands_separator, and decimal_separator.
- Bugfix: Various animation bugs in the UI

### 2.1.0
- You can no longer use has_one or has_many fields in the $edit property. This is because those relationships require a new item to be created on the other table.
- The number field now formats nicely in the interface
- Added the first tutorial video to the README and added the code from that video to the examples/application directory
- Bugfix: There was a case sensitivity issue with the libraries folder because of the namespaces I was using. Quickfixed this by changing libraries to Libraries.
- Bugfix: Getting model rows was calling 'SELECT * FROM [whatever_relationship_table]' multiple times. This should alleviate some performance issues.
