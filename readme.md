# Laravel Administrator Bundle

Administrator is a database interface bundle for the Laravel PHP framework. Administrator provides a visual interface to manage the data models on your site as you define them. In its most basic configuration, all you have to do is extend your application's Eloquent data models and provide a couple more configuration options.

## Laravel 4

This bundle currently only works with **Laravel 3**. Laravel 4 should probably be finalized sometime in May 2013, and as such I'm planning on making Administrator 4 compatible with Laravel 4. At that point, I will move Administrator <4 to another GitHub repo and make this repo the primary Administrator 4+ composer repo.
