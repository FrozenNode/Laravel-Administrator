# Laravel Administrator Bundle

Administrator is a database interface bundle for the Laravel PHP framework. Administrator provides a visual interface to manage the data models on your site as you define them. In its most basic configuration, all you have to do is extend your application's Eloquent data models and provide a couple more configuration options.
