# Laravel Administrator

Administrator is a database interface package for the Laravel PHP framework. Administrator provides a visual interface to manage the data models on your site as you define them. In its most basic configuration, all you have to do is reference your application's Eloquent data models and provide a couple more configuration options.

## Composer

To install Administrator as a Composer package to be used with Laravel 4, simply add this to your composer.json:

```json
"frozennode/administrator": "dev-master"
```

..and run `composer install`.  Once it is installed, you can register the service provider in `app/config/app.php` in the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => array(
    'Frozennode\Administrator\AdministratorServiceProvider',
)
```

Then publish the config file with `php artisan config:publish frozennode/administrator`. This will add the file `app/config/packages/frozennode/administrator/administrator.php`. This [config file](http://administrator.frozennode.com/docs/configuration) is the primary way you interact with Administrator.

### Laravel 3

Since Administrator has switched over to Composer, you can no longer use `php artisan bundle:install administrator` or `php artisan bundle:upgrade administrator`. If you want to use Administrator with Laravel 3, you must switch to the [3.3.2 branch](https://github.com/FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator/tree/3.3.2), download it, and add it in the `/bundles/administrator` directory and add this to your bundles.php file:

```php
'administrator' => array(
    'handles' => 'admin', //this determines what URI this bundle will use
    'auto' => true,
),
```
