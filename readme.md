# Laravel Administrator

Administrator is an administrative interface builder for [Laravel](http://laravel.com). With Administrator you can visually manage your Eloquent models and their relations, and also create stand-alone settings pages for storing site data and performing site tasks.

## Composer

To install Administrator as a Composer package to be used with Laravel 5, simply add this to your composer.json:

```json
"frozennode/administrator": "dev-master"
```

For Laravel 4 you can still do this:

```json
"frozennode/administrator": "4.*"
```

..and run `composer update`.  Once it's installed, you can register the service provider in `(app/)config/app.php` in the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => array(
    'Frozennode\Administrator\AdministratorServiceProvider',
)
```

### Laravel 5

Then publish the config file with `php artisan vendor:publish`. This will add the file `config/administrator.php`. This [config file](http://administrator.frozennode.com/docs/configuration) is the primary way you interact with Administrator.

Next to that all the assets, views and translation files will be published too.

Since the HTML & Form generators aren't part of the core in this version don't forget to also add the HTML ServiceProvider

```php
'providers' => array(
    'Illuminate\Html\HtmlServiceProvider',
)
```

and facades to `aliases` in your app config:

```php
'aliases' => array(
    'Form' => 'Illuminate\Html\FormFacade',
    'HTML' => 'Illuminate\Html\HtmlFacade',
)
```

### Laravel 4

Then publish the config file with `php artisan config:publish frozennode/administrator`. This will add the file `app/config/packages/frozennode/administrator/administrator.php`. This [config file](http://administrator.frozennode.com/docs/configuration) is the primary way you interact with Administrator.

Then finally you need to publish the package's assets with the `php artisan asset:publish frozennode/administrator` command.

### Laravel 3

Since Administrator has switched over to Composer, you can no longer use `php artisan bundle:install administrator` or `php artisan bundle:upgrade administrator`. If you want to use Administrator with Laravel 3, you must switch to the [3.3.2 branch](https://github.com/FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator/tree/3.3.2), download it, and add it in the `/bundles/administrator` directory and add this to your bundles.php file:

```php
'administrator' => array(
    'handles' => 'admin', //this determines what URI this bundle will use
    'auto' => true,
),
```
